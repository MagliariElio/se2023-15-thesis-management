# Thesis Management System

## Update database model, data and rebuild your local database

When adding new tables, altering existing tables or modifying data, you need to update the Thesis-Management-System.sql file.

Do this by adding the SQL Query to the Thesis-Management-System.sql file, then push the changes to the repository so that everyone can benefit from the changes.

To rebuild your local database and align it, run the following commands :

```bash
cd backend
npm run rbrebuild
```

## Conceptual design

The goal is to implement Thesis Management System for PoliTO. The primary entities include "Degree," representing different academic degrees they can be followed my 0 or many students. A student is always associated to one or many degrees.
"Student" contains student information with enrollment details such as the degree.
"Career" contains information about exams taken by a student (cfu, grade, date).
The "Proposals" entity list thesis projects, proposed by teachers.
"Applications" entity tracks student applications for thesis proposals. A student can applied to as many proposal as he wants. A proposal can be applied by 0 or many students.
"StudentNotifs" (Student Notifications) entity contains all the notifications sent to the students.

In this design 4 tables can NOT be modified :

- Teacher
- Student
- Degree
- Career

## Logical design

### Translation of entities and associations

- Degree: [**cod_degree** (PK), **title_degree**]
- Student: [**id** (PK), **surname**, **name**, **gender**, **nationality**, **email**, *cod_degree*, **enrollment_year**]
- Teacher: [**id** (PK), **surname**, **name**, **email**, cod_group, **cod_department**]
- Career: [**id** (PK), **cod_course** (PK), **title_course**, **cfu**, **grade**, **date**]
- Proposals: [**proposal_id** (PK), **title**, *supervisor_id*, **keywords**, **type**, **groups**, **description**, **required_knowledge**, **notes**, **expiration_date**, **level**, **programmes**, **archived**]
- Applications: [**id** (PK), *proposal_id*, *student_id*, **status**, **application_date**]
- StudentNotifs: [**id** (PK), *channel*, *student_id*, *campaign*, *subject*, *content*, *creation*, *status*, *lastupdate*]

## How to install ?

Refers to Elio documentation for DBEaver or to Docker compose documentation. üòÉ

If you experienced error using DBEaver, try to drop the database from your terminal : `dropdb Thesis-Management-System`

### ***Database Access via Terminal***

To access the database via the command line, we use the 

`psql -U postgres -W` command, and it will prompt us to enter the password. 

Once we are granted access, we can type the command `\l`to view the list of all databases in the system, including ‚ÄúThesis-Management-System‚Äù.

Using the command `\c Thesis-Management-System`, we can select the desired database (this may prompt us to enter the password again). With the command `\d`, we can retrieve a list of all available tables.

Alternatively, we can log out using `\q` and then enter the command `psql -d Thesis-Management-System -U postgres -W`, where, after entering the correct password, we will be directly logged into the specified database.
