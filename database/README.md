# Thesis Management System

## Conceptual design

The goal is to implement Thesis Management System for PoliTO. The primary entities include "Degree," representing different academic degrees they can be followed my 0 or many students. A student is always associated to one or many degrees.
"Student," contains student information with enrollment details such as the degree.
"Career," contains an exam informations (cpu, grade, date) taken by a student, one career is associated to one student but a student can have many careers (related to all exams he had). The link between student and career detail is stored in ‚Äúpassed‚Äù table.
The "Proposals" entity list thesis projects, proposed by teachers.
"Applications" entity tracks student applications for thesis proposals. A student can applied to as many proposal as he wants. A proposal can be applied by 0 or many students.

In this design 4 tables can NOT be modified :

- Teacher
- Student
- Degree
- Career

## Logical design

### Translation of entities and associations

- Degree: [**cod_degree** (PK), **title_degree**]
- Student: [**id** (PK), **surname**, **name**, **gender**, **nationality**, **email**, *cod_degree*, **enrollment_year**]
- Teacher: [**id** (PK), **surname**, **name**, **email**, cod_group, **cod_department**]
- Career: [**id** (PK), **cod_course**, **title_course**, **cfu**, **grade**, **date**]
- Passed: [**pid** (PK), *career_id*, *id* ]
- Proposals: [**proposal_id** (PK), **title**, *supervisor_id*, **keywords**, **type**, **groups**, **description**, **required_knowledge**, **notes**, **expiration_date**, **level**, **cds_programmes**]
- Applications: [**application_id** (PK), *proposal_id*, *id*, **status**, **application_date**]

## How to install ?

Refers to Elio documentation for DBEaver or to Docker compose documentation. üòÉ

If you experienced error using DBEaver, try to drop the database from your terminal : `dropdb Thesis-Management-System`

### ***Database Access via Terminal***

To access the database via the command line, we use the 

`psql -U postgres -W` command, and it will prompt us to enter the password. 

Once we are granted access, we can type the command `\l`to view the list of all databases in the system, including ‚ÄúThesis-Management-System‚Äù.

Using the command `\c Thesis-Management-System`, we can select the desired database (this may prompt us to enter the password again). With the command `\d`, we can retrieve a list of all available tables.

Alternatively, we can log out using `\q` and then enter the command `psql -d Thesis-Management-System -U postgres -W`, where, after entering the correct password, we will be directly logged into the specified database.
